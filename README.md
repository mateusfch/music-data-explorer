# Music Data Explorer
This is a study of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib aiming to explore and create datasets about music in order to build visualizations. 

In the first project, was explored the dataset "Billboard Hot 100 Songs (1958 - 2021)," obtained from a .csv file available for free on the Kaggle website. The Billboard Hot 100 ranks songs based on their popularity and is updated weekly, featuring 100 positions where the first (#1) corresponds to the most popular song of the week. The analysis centered around identifying artists with the highest number of songs reaching the number 1 position on the chart. Furthermore, an analysis was conducted to map all the songs that entered the chart by a specific artist. The following results were obtained:

1) The artists with most No. 1 Songs between 1958 and 2021
